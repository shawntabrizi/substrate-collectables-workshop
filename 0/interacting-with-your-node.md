Interacting With Your Node
===

By the end of this tutorial we will have you create your own custom UI to interact with your collectables blockchain. In the meantime, we can use the [Polkadot-JS](https://polkadot.js.org) Apps UI which is a generalized interface that adapts to your custom node.

In your web browser, navigate to:

https://polkadot.js.org/apps/

> Some browsers, notably Firefox, will not connect to a local node from an https website. An easy work around is to try another browser, like Chromium. Another option is to [host this interface locally](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps#development).

To point the UI to your local node, you need to adjust the **Settings**. Just select 'Local Node (127.0.0.1:9944)' from the endpoint dropdown:

```
Settings > remote node/endpoint to connect to > Local Node (127.0.0.1:9944)
```

After you press **Save and Reload**, you should notice the Polkadot-JS Apps UI come to life.
Note that you should have your `./target/release/substratekitties --dev` chain up and running while browsing the Polkadot UI.

Note that we will import a JSON file with additional type definitions later on in section "Registering a Custom Struct" of Section 1 > Viewing a Structure.

Let's go into the **Transfer** app, and make a transaction. The default account named "Alice" is pre-funded with a ton of *Units*.

Share some with "Bob" by creating a transaction. You should see a confirmation appear when the transaction has completed, and Bob's balance will also be updated.

Here you can see just how quickly we set up, ran, and interacted with our own local Substrate chain.

**Learn More**

The [Substrate UI](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-ui) that has been built using the [oo7-substrate library](https://github.com/paritytech/oo7/tree/master/packages/oo7-substrate) is an alternative front-end interface to the [Polkadot-JS Apps UI](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) for interacting with your Substrate chain.

When building your own UI, you can refer to the [Polkadot-JS API Documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/api/) and the [oo7 API Documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/oo7/).
