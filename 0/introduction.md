Introduction
===

We are going to start off easy and just get our development environment set up.

This process takes about 15-30 min depending on how quickly your computer can compile Rust code.

At the end of this section, you will have started a custom Substrate node using the `substrate-node-template` and interact with it using the Polkadot-JS Apps UI.
