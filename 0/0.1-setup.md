Setup
===

Before you get started installing and running Substrate, there are a few prerequisites that should be installed on your development environment:

 - [Node + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or an IDE of your choice)
 - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or a chrome based browser (sorry FF users :[ )

[TODO: The people using these distros will know that. They just need to know Substrate needs Openssl, Rust, etc..]

The Substrate framework provides a set of simple commands to set up your local environment.

These commands will:
 - Install a package manager for your operating system
 - Install the Rust development environment
 - Install the core Substrate binaries
 - Install [additional helper scripts](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-up) for quick development of new Substrate nodes

Unfortunately, since the installation process can be unique per operating system and machine, this script may not always work out of the box. You can [take a look at the script directly](https://getsubstrate.io/), and adjust it for your particular development environment.

When you are ready, run:

```bash
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash
```

This process can take a while since it will be compiling multiple binaries from the source, so grab some tea while you wait.
