// Tests for the Kitties Pallet.
//
// Normally this file would be split into two parts: `mock.rs` and `tests.rs`.
// The `mock.rs` file would contain all the setup code for our `TestRuntime`.
// Then `tests.rs` would only have the tests for our pallet.
// However, to minimize the project, these have been combined into this single file.
//
// Learn more about creating tests for Pallets:

// This flag tells rust to only run this file when running `cargo test`.
