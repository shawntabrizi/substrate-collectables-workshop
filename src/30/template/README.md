# Set Price Extrinsic

Now that we have our Pallet set up to handle balances, let's actually use them.

In this step, we will create an extrinsic which allows the owner of a kitty to set a price for the kitty.

## Set Price

The set price extrinsic is pretty straight forward.

As we noted in the last step, we allow the `price` field of a kitty to be `Option<BalanceOf<T>>`, where `None` denotes a kitty which is not for sale, and `Some(price)` denotes a kitty which is for sale at some `price`.

With this in mind, our `set_price` extrinsic will also accept an `Option<BalanceOf<T>>` so that a user can put the kitty on or off the market.

## Your Turn

In this step, you will scaffold the extrinsic and internal functions for `set_price`.

- Create a new event `PriceSet` with the fields noted in the template.
- Create a new extrinsic `set_price` with the params noted in the template.
- Create a new internal function `do_set_price` which simply deposits the `PriceSet` event.

We will actually populate the logic for `do_set_price` in the next step.
