## Checking Our Work in the Polkadot UI

Even though this code should compile without errors, now would be a good time to check out work.

After running:

```
./build.sh
cargo build --release
substrate purge-chain --dev
```

we can start our node:

```
./target/release/substrate-cryptokitties --dev
```

If we go back into the [Polkadot UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps), we should see evidence of our node producing blocks.

Go to the **Extrinsics** tab
