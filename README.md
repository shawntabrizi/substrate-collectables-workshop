# Pallet Struct

The `Pallet` struct is the anchor on which we implement all logic and traits for our Pallet.

```rust
#[pallet::pallet]
pub struct Pallet<T>(core::marker::PhantomData<T>);
```

## Function Implementations

For example, when you look more at the template, you will see code like:

```rust
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
	// -- snip --
}
```

This is just regular Rust and how you would implement functions on a struct.

## Trait Implementations

Imagine we had a trait `Hooks` we wanted to implement, we would also use the `Pallet` struct to do that:

```rust
impl<T: Config> Hooks for Pallet<T> {
	fn on_finalize() {
		// -- snip --
	}
}
```

And then we could access that those functions like:

```rust
pallet_kitties::Pallet::<T>::on_finalize();
```

In fact, many traits are automatically implemented on top of `Pallet` and are accessible thanks to the `#[pallet::pallet]` attribute macro.

### FRAME Traits

You can see all the different traits implemented on `Pallet` by looking at the [autogenerated Rust docs](https://docs.rs/pallet-sudo/latest/pallet_sudo/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#trait-implementations).

One simple example is the trait [`PalletInfoAccess`](https://docs.rs/frame-support/38.0.0/frame_support/traits/trait.PalletInfoAccess.html).

With this trait, you can do things like call `pallet_kitties::Pallet::<T>::module_name()` which will return to you the name of the rust module, in this case `pallet_kitties`. Information like this is used mostly between other macros, which is why we hide it all from you behind the macros.

In this tutorial, you will not interact with any of these automatically generated traits, but knowing that they exist can allow you to investigate further after learning the basics.
